# Schematic
The supplied KiCad files should be sufficient as both a schematic and as a  starting point for ordering PCBs (basically you could just zip the contents of the export folder and upload that on a fabrication site), the schematic is also available in [PDF-format](https://github.com/tebl/MSX-Mega-Adapter/blob/master/export/MSX%20Mega%20Adapter.pdf) and this is what you'll need to print and work your way through this things don't work as expected after assembly.

# BOM
Most parts should be easy to get a hold of from your favourite local electronic component shop, but given that I don't have access to such shops where I live so everything was based on whatever I could get cheapest from eBay/AliExpress (free shipping, plan on waiting 3-4 weeks for delivery though).
